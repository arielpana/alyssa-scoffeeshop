	<p><b>Phase:</b><br>Operational Transitions<br><br>
Diagram/Matrix/chart that needs to be changed: Efficiency and productivity criteria for coffee layout
redesigned.</p>


<p><b>Updated Diagram/Matrix Chart:</b></p>

<p><b>Reason for the Change:</b><br> There was no explicit mention of positive comments in the initial set of
criteria for consumer feedback on menu variety and quality. Positive customer reviews are now
specifically included as a criterion in the updated chart, giving a clearer indicator of how well the new
menu items are received and accepted by customers.</p>


<p><b>Phase:</b><br>Technology Transitions<br><br>

Diagram/Matrix/Chart that Needs to be Changed: Staff Training and Adoption Criteria for POS System
Integration</p>

<p><b>Updated Diagram</b></p>

<img src="Screenshot 2023-12-17 164641.png" width="400" height="300"><br>


<p><b>Reason for the Change:</b><br> The initial criteria for staff training and adoption did not explicitly link staff
training to the successful integration of the POS system. The updated chart includes a clear connection
between staff training, technology adoption, and the overall success of the POS system integration,
providing a more comprehensive evaluation of this phase.</p>
